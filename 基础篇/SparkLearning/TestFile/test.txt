Logstash has the following flags. You can use the --help flag to display this information.
Specify the name of this Logstash instance. If no value is given it will default to the current hostname.
Load the Logstash config from a specific file or directory. If a directory is given, all files in that directory will be concatenated in lexicographical order and then parsed as a single config file. Specifying this flag multiple times is not supported. If you specify this flag multiple times, Logstash uses the last occurrence (for example, -f foo -f bar is the same as -f bar).
You can specify wildcards (globs) and any matched files will be loaded in the order described above. For example, you can use the wildcard feature to load specific files by name:
bin/logstash --debug -f '/tmp/{one,two,three}'
With this command, Logstash concatenates three config files, /tmp/one, /tmp/two, and /tmp/three, and parses them into a single config.
Use the given string as the configuration data. Same syntax as the config file. If no input is specified, then the following is used as the default input: input { stdin { type => stdin } } and if no output is specified, then the following is used as the default output: output { stdout { codec => rubydebug } }. If you wish to use both defaults, please use the empty string for the -e flag. The default is nil.
Launch the named module. Works in conjunction with the -M option to assign values to default variables for the specified module. If --modules is used on the command line, any modules in logstash.yml will be ignored, as will any settings there. This flag is mutually exclusive to the -f and -e flags. Only one of -f, -e, or --modules may be specified. Multiple modules can be specified by separating them with a comma, or by invoking the --modules flag multiple times.
Assign a value to a configurable option for a module. The format for assigning variables is -M "MODULE_NAME.var.PLUGIN_TYPE.PLUGIN_NAME.KEY_NAME=value" for Logstash variables. For other settings, it will be -M "MODULE_NAME.KEY_NAME.SUB_KEYNAME=value". The -M flag can be used as many times as is necessary. If no -M options are specified, then the default value for that setting will be used. The -M flag is only used in conjunction with the --modules flag. It will be ignored if the --modules flag is absent.
Sets the ID of pipeline. The default is main.
Sets the number of pipeline workers to run. This option sets the number of workers that will, in parallel, execute the filter and output stages of the pipeline. If you find that events are backing up, or that the CPU is not saturated, consider increasing this number to better utilize machine processing power. The default is the number of the hostâ€™s CPU cores.
